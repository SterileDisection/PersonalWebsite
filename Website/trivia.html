        <h2>How I Made This Game</h2>
        <h2>HTML Structure:</h2>
        <p>I structured the HTML to create the foundation of the trivia game.</p>
        <p>Elements were carefully chosen to accommodate the game canvas, question display, answer buttons, and
            navigation controls.</p>

        <h2>CSS Styling:</h2>
        <p>I applied CSS styling to enhance the layout, colors, and fonts of the trivia game.</p>
        <p>Layout configurations were adjusted to position elements as intended, ensuring consistency and visual appeal.
        </p>
        <p>To improve presentation, I utilized background colors, borders, and other styles.</p>

        <h2>JavaScript Functionality:</h2>
        <p>Javascript played a crucial role in controlling the game's behavior and logic.</p>
        <p>I initialized game variables to manage the current question, score, and user interaction.</p>
        <p>Functions were implemented to display questions, handle user answers, calculate scores, and manage game
            progression.</p>

        <h2>Game Logic:</h2>
        <p>I defined the gameplay mechanics and rules to ensure an engaging trivia experience.</p>
        <p>Core mechanics such as displaying questions, processing answers, and tracking scores were implemented.</p>
        <p>Clear instructions and feedback were integrated into the game to guide and inform the player throughout their
            trivia experience.</p>
        <p>Thorough testing was conducted to verify the game's functionality and ensure it delivers an enjoyable user
            experience.</p>
