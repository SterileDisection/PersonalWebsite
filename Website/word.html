            <h2>How I Made This Game</h2>
            <h2>HTML Structure:</h2>
            <p>I defined the basic structure of the webpage, incorporating elements essential for the Word Guessing
                Game.</p>
            <p>This includes components such as the game title, word display, input field for guesses, buttons for
                submitting guesses, resetting the game, and an option to quit to the portfolio.</p>

            <h2>CSS Styling:</h2>
            <p>To enhance the visual appeal and layout of the elements, I applied CSS styling.</p>
            <p>Layout adjustments were made to position elements as desired while ensuring consistency and visual
                appeal.</p>
            <p>I utilized background colors, borders, and other stylistic elements to augment the overall presentation
                of the game.</p>

            <h2>JavaScript Functionality:</h2>
            <p>JavaScript played a pivotal role in controlling the game's behavior and logic.</p>
            <p>At the outset, I initialized the game by selecting a random word and displaying it to the player.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I implemented functions to facilitate checking guesses, providing feedback to the player,
                and updating the game state accordingly.</p>
            <p>User input, such as submitting guesses and resetting the game, was managed to ensure seamless
                interaction, with updates reflected in the display.</p>

            <h2>Game Logic:</h2>
            <p>The Word Guessing Game adheres to specific gameplay mechanics and rules.</p>
            <p>Players are restricted to guessing one letter at a time and receive immediate feedback on their guesses.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, each word is accompanied by a hint to aid players in their guessing endeavors.</p>
            <p>Win conditions are defined to congratulate players upon successfully guessing the word.</p>
